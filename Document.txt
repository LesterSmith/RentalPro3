The data for a customer is made up of Customers, Invoices (Hdr), and invoice_detail
records in the database.  Each customer has one customer record.  Each customer can
have many Invoices (hdr).  Each Invoices record has two or more invoice_detail
records.

Invoice_Detail records have record_types as follows:
   15 - Line item (rental or sale).  RentOrSale field of the record will be = 
        "Rent" or "Sale".
   25 = deposit
   35 = tax
   45 = delivery
   55 = AmtPaid(only if pmt made)
   65 = refund at check in
   75 = Balance due after checkin
   67 = Cash on account      
   66 = Credit Memo
   68 = Debit Memo
   
   Invoice Detail records will all have the same invoice id (number).  Even Credit
   memos, debit memos, and cash on accout will reference have the same number.  So
   when an invoice is printed, all records should be taken into account to compute
   the outstanding balance of the invoice.
   
   The invoice date is carried in the Rented_date field of the invoice_detail 
   record.
